1. Introduction and problem statement
What problem are you trying to solve? Why is this important?

### 2. Background
Has this been done before? How? If not, what's the closest related research? (Both using similar approaches and other algorithms.) What's novel with your research?

### 3. Methods
How does your algorithm/idea work? Describe in as much detail as you can fit into the report. 

### 4. Results
Did it work? How well? Provide some figures, and a table or two. Reread some of the papers from class and compare how they report their results.

### 5. Discussion
What are the strengths and shortcomings of your method? Why did you choose method X instead of Y? How would you develop it further, if you had time?

### 6. References
